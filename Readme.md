KidPilot is a game where parents can prepare their kids for their flight by running around the airport and taking pictures of everything they find! Backed by user research, KidPilot targets parents' pain points in traveling with small children: getting around the airport with a lot of luggage, squirmy children on flights, a need for educating their kids on flight etiquette, and a way to get them off a screen by engaging with KidPilot.

KidPilot engages kids by sending them on a scavenger hunt for objects and places you'd typically find in an airport: restaurants, suitcases, water fountains, security lines. The pressure is on with a timer that, when it runs out, ends the game. The length of the game is tailored to how long the layover is. If kids complete the scavenger hunt before the layover is over, they can win cool prizes!

KidPilot also makes sure to educate on flight etiquette: how to act when in line, how to act if people are sleeping in the plane, all the things may not be second nature to kids.

##Demo
Run the demo by forking this repository, and running <br><br>
`python script.py`

You'll be able to see how the script handles the mocked data from the API, and a glimpse of how an Google Vision API integration might fit into this application.
